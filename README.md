## PATHFINDING VISUALIZER
Visualizes how pathfinding algorithms work.

**How to use:**

 - Use `npm install` in the project directory to install dependencies.
 - Use `npm start` to start the server.
 
 **Functionality**
 
 - Toggle walls on and off.
 - Create multiple walls by pressing and dragging the mouse.
 - Move start and finish node positions.
 - Recalculate shortest path by dragging the finish node to a new location after pathfinding algorithm has finished.
 - Create mazes with recursive division maze algorithm.
